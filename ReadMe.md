# JanataWiFi Full Stack Project

### About

I developed a full-stack **CRUD** web application with **React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Django, MySQL** within **4 days**, resolving complex errors. Upload Frontend on **Netlify**, backend on **PythonAnywhere**.It was My first **Django project**. I developed this project for **JanataWiFi** Organisation.

### ðŸš€ Live Demo

- **Frontend Live Link:** [https://taibjanatawifi.netlify.app/](https://taibjanatawifi.netlify.app/)
- **Backend Live Link:** [https://taib0110.pythonanywhere.com/](https://taib0110.pythonanywhere.com/)

### Resolved Error

1.  **Initial Setup:**

    - Backend developed with Django and PostgreSQL, hosted on Aiven.
    - Django API deployed to PythonAnywhere.

    - **Initial Error:** PythonAnywhere failed to establish a persistent TCP/IP connection to the Aiven PostgreSQL database, resulting in connection refusal.

    - **Solution:** To resolve this, I switched to using PythonAnywhere's free hosted MySQL database.

2.  **Connection Per Operation:**

    - Implemented a connection-per-operation strategy,
      establishing a new database connection and performing cursor operations for each CRUD request.

    - **Subsequent Error:** PythonAnywhere terminate short-lived connections. causing intermittent
      OperationalError.

    - **Solution:** To Prevent this problem, I implemented per connection for per operation.

3. **Rendering Large Data**
    - The file contained 15,932 documents with data.

    - **Performance Issue:** Rendering this large dataset on the webpage resulted in slow performance and a poor user experience.
    
    - **Solution:** Implemented `react-virtualized` for efficient rendering of large datasets.
